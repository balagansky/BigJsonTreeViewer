* Optimize file reading
 + parse while reading! (bottleneck will be the slower of the two)
 + memory mapped IO ?
 + overlapped IO?
* Replace rapidjson with simdjson (4x faster?) - might not be the bottleneck though

Feature Wishlist:
* Memory limit settings - dedupe strings to try to keep under limit
 + Use trie with efficient allocator for optimal memory usage
 + simple map might be good enough
